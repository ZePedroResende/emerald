tittle: Window Managers
---
Recently i was given the opportunity to make a talk about window managers , more specifically tilling window managers.

I've been using i3wm ( a tilling/dynamic window manager ) for about a year and i'm on that point where i can't work properly without it. In the beggining its hard to get used to it but as soon has you learn to work without the mouse and to use the keyboard shortcuts you become 200% more productive and faster ( that and you can see a good film while coding without losing losts of space ).

I knew what i wanted to talk about now i had to make a really cool and fun talk so people didn't think i was crazy for using such a weird concept like a tilling window manager that usually locks ugly as hell and is a barebones experience. At that time one of my house mates told me to use slides.com and make some slides just as a trial , after one hour of fun and a hole lot of instalations of window managers in a debian vm i had my little presentation. 
Despite these slides not containing all text from the talk, you can see it  [here](http://slides.com/resende/deck#/) .
