tittle: Do you feel safe ?
---
So this year there was an opportunity to give two talks/workshops directed to the first year students of my course, and has the applied third year student that i am, i auto volunteered as a speaker.

So the first talk i gave war with [@p3rsephone](http://github.com/p3rsephone) about security. Tl dr; it was an "Introduction to be a Scrpt-Kiddie", this means all the nmap basics, xss,sql injections and a little bit of an Introduction to cracking an reverse engineering.

This are simple concepts (in the most part) as it was directed to stimulate the interest  of the new students beacause this topic is not discussed in any class that we take.

We had slides made for this and you can see [them ](https://github.com/p3rsephone/SecurityTalk)
