tittle: Introduction to the unix shell
---
If you read my [last post](https://zepedroresende.github.io/do-you-feel-safe) you allready know that i gave two talks to the new students of Software engineering at Universidade do Minho

So the Second talk i gave was with [@0urobor0s](http://github.com/0urobor0s) about the unix shell, has we use linux and unix like systems in our classes.

In this talk we taught and analized diferent shells like zshs and bash. Thease are simple concepts (in the most part) but necessary for the course and a faster and easier development, especially for noobies .

We use [this slides](https://speakerdeck.com/62gerente/bash-introduction) made by two previous member of CeSIUM, the organisation that we are part of.
